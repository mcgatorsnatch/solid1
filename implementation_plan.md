# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Memory Systems

- **QuantumMemory**: Core memory storage and retrieval
  - [x] Implement `add_memory` and `search` (vector-based)
  - [x] Add chunking for long content
  - [x] Implement metadata tracking
  - [x] Add importance scoring
  - [x] Implement temporal decay
  - [x] Add memory access tracking 
  - [x] Implement episodic buffer
  - [x] Add optional trainable neural gates (g_t = sigma(W_g * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_g))

> **Note on Pruning Logic**: Initially planned for implementation in `memory_core.py`, the pruning logic was ultimately implemented in `orchestrator.py` within the `_recursive_learning_loop` method (Phase 4). This provides better centralized control of memory maintenance operations as part of the cognitive cycle. The memory class provides the supporting methods (`_prune_synaptic_connections` and `_merge_similar_memories`), but the orchestration of when and how to apply pruning is handled by the recursive learning loop.

> **Note on Memory Gates**: The optional trainable gates implementation allows the system to dynamically learn when to transfer memories between buffers, using a neural network instead of a fixed similarity threshold. This is provided as an option with a fallback to the similarity-based mechanism to accommodate hardware constraints.

## Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning

- **RLAgent**: Learning agent 
  - [x] Implement PPO using Stable-Baselines3
  - [x] Create meta-learning controller
  - [x] Transfer learning bridge
  - [x] Implement knowledge distillation
  - [x] Add prioritized experience replay
  - [x] Support dual-time scale adaptation
  - [x] Implement emergency recovery mechanism

> **Note on PPO Implementation**: The initial design called for a Q-learning approach, but this was upgraded to a more sophisticated Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation via Stable-Baselines3, providing better performance for continuous state spaces and complex decision-making tasks.

## Phase 3: Planning and Reasoning

- **HyperPlanner**: Hierarchical planning and decomposition
  - [x] Beam search decomposition
  - [x] Temporal attention weighting
  - [x] Cross-validation framework
  - [x] RL-driven prioritization
  - [x] Concept drift detection
  - [x] Adaptive planning thresholds
  - [x] Knowledge schema extraction

## Phase 4: Recursive Learning Loop

- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination with dual-time adaptation
  - [x] Fast adaptation cycle (30s)
  - [x] Slow adaptation cycle (24h)
  - [x] Memory pruning and consolidation
  - [x] Hebbian learning implementation
  - [x] Memory schema formation
  - [x] Emergency recovery mechanisms
  - [x] Meta-parameter optimization
