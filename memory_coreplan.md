The recursive learning process flows through multiple timescales:

1. **Perception-Action Loop (milliseconds)**
   - Real-time response to user queries
   - Immediate context retrieval and attention focusing
   - Application of current knowledge models

2. **Working Memory Processes (seconds)**
   - Fast adaptation of parameters based on immediate feedback
   - Hebbian connection updates
   - Episodic buffer processing
   - Minor RL adjustments

3. **Consolidation Processes (minutes)**
   - Memory consolidation from episodic to semantic
   - Planning strategy optimization
   - World model updates
   - Transfer learning across domains

4. **Deep Learning Processes (hours)**
   - Full reinforcement learning training cycles
   - Memory index rebuilding
   - Pattern analysis across all experiences
   - Meta-learning parameter optimization

## Implementation Architecture

### Concurrency Model
- Asynchronous coroutines for primary operations
- Process pools for computation-intensive tasks
- Event-driven architecture for adaptive scheduling
- Fault-tolerant execution with graceful degradation

### Data Flow
1. User input → Context retrieval → Response generation → Memory storage
2. Periodic triggers → Recursive learning cycles → System adaptation
3. Performance metrics → Goal generation → Parameter optimization

### Error Recovery
